# Learning to Optimize

This code repository is a small playground to use tensorflow in order to re-implement parts of the 
research paper of Ke Li and Jitendra Malik [Learning to Optimize](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01885.pdf)

This was inspired by Ke's [BAIR blog](http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/) post on
[Learning to Optimize with Reinforcement Learning](http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/09/12/learning-to-optimize-with-rl/)
